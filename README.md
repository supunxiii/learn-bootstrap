## Overview

learn-bootstrap is a code-short note to understand the basics of Bootstrap, designed as a simple, code-first learning aid. To learn, users can uncomment the code lines and run the HTML file to see how each concept works in practice. It briefly covers core theory such as containers, the grid system, typography, responsive images, embeds, navigation bars, tables, forms, alerts, cards, and modals.
